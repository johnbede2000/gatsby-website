            Driven by an electrifying rhythm section of hand percussion, hand
            claps and flamenco dance, the band performs John's original jazz
            compositions fusing fiery flamenco grooves with adventurous
            improvisation from flute player Gareth Lockrane and others. The band
            has performed to sell-out audiences at the London Jazz Festival,
            Love Supreme Festival, and top jazz venues such as The Vortex and
            Pizza Express Jazz Club Soho.

            "Inspired by flamenco, especially my experiences of live
            performances, I was driven to find a way to incorporate some of
            those undefinable flashes of life, creation, emotion and passion
            into my own medium â€“ instrumental jazz compositions. Seeming like a
            good cohesive theme to hold an album project together, I ventured
            forth on this musical adventure, crossing the threshold of releasing
            an album under my name. I chose various flamenco styles that
            particularly resonated with me, and used those as compositional
            starting points."
